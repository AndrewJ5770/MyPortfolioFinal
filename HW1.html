    <h1>The Best Movies According to Andrew</h1>
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
    <hr>
    <h3>Fantastic Mr. Fox</h3>
    <p>This movie has a very creative story and it being backed with the intriguing polot that all the animals must work together for mutual surviavl, it creates a wonderful movie.</p>
    <h3>The Truman Show</h3>
    <p>Truman lives an ideal life in his hometown, however, not everthing is what it seems as it is all a ploy by a director using Truman for a TV show. This movie tackles the ideas of whats real and whats fake and our lives can be manipulated.</p>
    <h3>Whiplash</h3>
    <p>I love this movie for its msuic but more for acting done by Miles Taylor and J.K. Simmons. They played their parts so well that I can't help but respect this movie.</p>
